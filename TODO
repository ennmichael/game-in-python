 * Have some proper blocks and collision checking
 * Enable Igor to jump
 * Have a proper background sprite
 * Enable Igor to do a flip in the air
 * Introduce the rotation mechanic
 * Enable Igor to run up walls
 * Enable Igor to jump against walls (do a flip sometimes there too)

 - Perhaps `sdl.Rectangle` should be modeled as `complex` + `sdl.Dimensions`?
   Think about this. `sdl.Rectangle`'s representation is not the native
   SDL_Rect anyways, and we want to avoid the annoying
   `complex` + `sdl.Dimensions` -> `sdl.Rectangle` conversions.
